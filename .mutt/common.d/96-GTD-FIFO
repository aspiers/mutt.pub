# GTD, inboxzero.com etc. say: one at a time, no fiddling!
# In other words, if you read a mail, you *have* to process it.
# So let's limit what we can see by default to the first thread;
# hopefully this will force me to adopt a FIFO habit.

# note that unquoted ! is a negation unary operator
#
# ~m 1 means first message
#
# ~(~m 1) means any message in same thread as first message
# but for some reason this sometimes excludes the first message
# so we OR them together:

folder-hook '!' 'push "<limit>~m 1 | ~(~m 1)<enter><display-message>"'
