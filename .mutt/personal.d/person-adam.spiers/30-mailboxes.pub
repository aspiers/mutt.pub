# Old approach
#macro index,pager i  "<change-folder>=in/\t\tj"  "show main inboxes"

# For some reason, if "<change-folder>?" is followed by pressing "q"
# to quit, it returns the user to the pager not the index.  This is
# desirable if the user was previously in the pager, but not if the
# user was previously in the index.  So, define two different macros
# to ensure that "q" will return the user to the mode they were
# previously in:
macro index i  "<change-folder><kill-line>\t\tj"  "show main inboxes"
macro pager i  "<change-folder>?"                 "show main inboxes"

# last matching rule wins
